Directions for running mlflow experiments

1. Create a Data Science Notebook on Oracle Cloud
    a. For testing create your own project or put them in notebook_test (do not put thme in Chance of Victory Models
       or COVID Recovery Models unless it's a real trial model
    b. Give it a name, it doesn't matter
    c. Give it Storage (rec 100-200 GB)
    d. Select Custom Networking ********This is very important**********
        i. VCN = model_db
        ii. Subnet = Private Subnet-model_db ***********This is very important*************
2. Enter DS Notebook and open terminal
3. Create a folder called mlflow_utils
4. Upload the contents of ml-covid-nba/mlflow_utils from git repo
5. In terminal
    a. cd mlflow_utils
    b. ./setup.sh
    c. cd ..
6. Install any model packages needed, base packages are installed in setup script
7. Duplicate starter_script.ipynb for each model you wish to run
***********You can stop here*************
8. Tune models on data (if using test data the performance will probably be poor)


Access mysql database (stores models, params, and metrics)
Have to ssh to oracle host
Linux machine: 129.153.2.48
username: team
password: NBACovid19!

ex ssh team@129.153.2.48
After connecting run ./mysql.sh -> this logs you into database
Run: USE test_db; enters you into base database then you can query tables
